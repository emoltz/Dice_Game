This project didn't take too much time. Even though I built it from scratch, I followed a tutorial on how to set up an interactive dice game and then modded it from there. I made the pig graphics on my own and figured out the logic behind the traditional pass the pigs game so the back-end could calculate the probability of the pigs landing in a certain way.

It works as-is at the moment, but there is a lot I'd like to do to it, namely making a mobile-friendly version.</p>
